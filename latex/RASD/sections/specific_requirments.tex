    \subsection{External Interface Requirements}

        \subsubsection{User Interfaces}
            CodeKataBattle's user interface will be used by both students and educators, so it should be easy to navigate and allow the use of all its functionalities to as many users as possible, regardless of the extent of their technical background. Therefore the interface has to be easy to use, intuitive and user-friendly on any kind of device.

        \subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
            The system revolves around the exchange of information and code solutions between the users and the system itself, so it doesn't require any specific external hardware interface to operate, it just needs to be securely reachable from the highest possible amount of people around the world
      
        \subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
            The system requires the presence of some external software interfaces in order to correctly operate:\\
            First of all, it requires some kind of repository service, to which educators will upload their code kata and which students will fork, in order to implement it with their code. Then each group of students will set up an automated procedure to inform CodeKataBattle of each new solution they will deliver through this system\\
            Once a new solution will be delivered by each group the application needs to have an automated evaluation system with which to automatically evaluate the functional aspects (measured in terms of number of test cases that are passed out of all the test cases, the higher the better), the timeliness (measured in terms of time passed between the registration deadline and the last commit performed by the group which made the delivery, the lower the better) and the quality level (extracted using static analysis tools that will consider aspects such as security, reliability, and maintainability of the code, the higher the better) of the sources obtained from the repository.\\
            Finally, for many important events that will take place while using the application (for example the creation of a tournament or the early closure of a battle), the system will use some kind of notification system to inform the user that such events have taken place (this system can be emails, windows notifications, smartphone notifications, sms or others), those notifications should also often (if possible) have some sort of way to quickly go from the notification itself straight to the application point of interest where that specific action is requested to the user (for example by clicking on the notification itself or by clicking/copying a possible direct link contained in the notification)
            \restoregeometry

            Regarding the user instead, to access the system itself no particular software is required, but such software is necessary to develop the solution to be delivered. In order to do that theoretically just a text editor would be enough, but the use of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) instead is strongly suggested, since it would make the development of such solution much easier and allow a more straightforward quick testing before the delivery

        \subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
            As already mentioned, the system revolves around the exchange of information and code solutions between the users and the system itself, so the system needs to be securely reachable from the highest possible amount of people around the world, to assure that communications will allways be enrypted using TLS 1.3 by the usage of the HTTPS protocol for each communication

    \subsection{Performance Requirements}
        Given the fact that in each of our battles it will be mandatory for the system to evaluate the timeliness of the delivery, it is of paramount importance for us to guarantee that as less time as possible is lost on our side to evaluate the solutions and to send back our results, (consisting in the new student's rank and battle score) to give each student participating in the battle as much time as possible to fix his/her mistakes and eventually submit a new solution. Unfortunately, we cannot interfere with each student's own transmission speed, so we'll only need to focus on how our system will behave once that new delivery becomes readable, while keeping also in mind that faster equipment will also be more expensive, so we have to balance those two contrasting needs.\\
        Therefore, we should be able to check whether a new solution has been delivered at least once every second, and have a fast computational speed to be able to evaluate a solution of average length, in a situation of average workload in at most 3 seconds.\\
        Finally, estimating the number of concurrent active user that we should expect is a hard question, since we have very few data regarding this topic, but we can see that a website with a similar structure called \url{www.codewars.com} has on average 2.4M access each month\cite{CodeWars data}, so we can assume for it to have an average of 833 concurrent user active at the same time\footnote{to calculate this approximate value we have assumed the user session on our website to last on average 15 minutes and the access to be uniformly spread over the course of the whole day and month, therefore we have assumed that every access made in the same quarter of hour will be considered concurrent: $\text{concurrent\_acceses} = \frac{\text{monthly\_acces}}{30*24*4}$}, therefore given the minor popularity that our system will have initially but also to deal with peak hours the system is required to be able to handle up to 1300 concurrent active users\newpage

    \subsection{Design Constraints}
        \subsubsection{Standards compliance}    
            CodeKataBattle's user data must be compliant with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a European Union regulation on information privacy, therefore the system must be able to store and process user data securely, and must be able to provide the user with a way to access, modify or delete his/her own data at any time.
    
        \subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
            Given the nature of the software, not much computational power is needed on the user-side, so any fairly powered machine would probably be enough for our users to effectively use the software. On the other hand an internet connection is required, in order to communicate and exchange data with the platform, and this internet connection is also strongly suggested to be fast and stable in order to grant the user a fair competition with his/her opponents (for example to avoid delays while reading the code kata, sending the delivery or receiving his/her updated battle score)

    \subsection{Software System Attributes}
        \subsubsection{Reliability}
            The system must have a backup infrastructure to ensure that the data is always available and that the system can be restored in case of a failure. The components of this infrastructure must be characterized by a high MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) and a low MTTR (Mean Time To Repair), in order to both reduce the amount of failures to a minimum and to be able to quickly recover when those failures actually happen. Moreover, all the needed components must be redundant and parallelized as much as possible, to ensure a high reliability of the overall system as well as fault-resilience in the case of a single component failure\newpage
        
        \subsubsection{Availability}
            CodeKataBattle is not an emergency service or anything related to critical situations, so it is considered enough for the system to provide an availability of 99.9\%, this means an average downtime of 8.77 hours per year, or 10.08 minutes a week, which is perfectly fine for our uses.\\
            Also, since CKB is expected to be used also by teacher during exercise classes and by student/workers in days when they are not going to school or work, the peak hours are expected to be from 9 to 12 during working days and from 15 to 19 during weekends, so the system should be able to handle a higher than average workload during these time-slots. For this reason all the maintenance activities should be done at night from Monday to Thursday when the system is less used.    

        \subsubsection{Security}
            The system store some sensitive personal information about its users, so the security aspect cannot be under-estimated, the data stored by the system must be protected and its communication with other components must be encrypted, to avoid any unauthorized interception.\\
            Therefore, all the user data must be stored securely, hashed and/or encrypted using approved algorithms that have not been cryptographically broken, like SHA-256 for hashing or AES-256 for encryption. Specifically, passwords should be stored only in their hashed version and subsequently the whole data stored regarding a user (including the hashed password) should be encrypted.\\  Furthermore, the communications between the server and any other component or external entity should be encrypted using TLS 1.3 and powered by HTTPS, to grant confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity to such communications.\\
            Finally, all stored data must be compliant with the GDPR.\newpage

        \subsubsection{Maintainability}
            The system must be easy to maintain and update, and must be able to be extended with new features in the future with ease. For this reason the system must be designed using a modular architecture, and must be developed using modern design patterns and best practices guaranteeing high reusability of its code, as well as future extensions of its features. A documentation for such code must also be produced which should be clear, complete and easy to understand. Finally, the system should also be tested using unit tests and integration tests covering all its modules before its release, to assert that no errors or conflicts are present       

        \subsubsection{Portability}
        The system should be designed to be easily ported into many platforms, providing equal functionalities in each of these versions, for example the system could be designed to work with most modern web browsers (like Google Chrome,  Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera or Safari, as well as possibly other Chromium based web browsers) and/or most of the modern desktop and mobile operating systems (like Windows, macOS, Linux, Android or iOS).
