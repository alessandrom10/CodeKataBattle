# CodeKataBattle

**CodeKataBattle (CKB)** is an innovative platform designed to enhance students' software development skills through peer training on code katas. Educators leverage the platform to create competitive code kata battles, allowing student teams to participate and improve their skills.

## Project Overview

This repository contains three primary documents that outline the development and implementation of the CodeKataBattle web application, along with the actual application code.

### 1. Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)

The RASD defines the high-level requirements and functional units of the application without dealing with implementation details. It includes:

- **Purpose and Goals**: Objectives and aims of the application.
- **Scenarios and Interactions**: Use cases and interactions with the environment and users.
- **Class Diagram**: High-level functional units representation.
- **Assumptions and Dependencies**: Necessary assumptions and dependencies for the application.
- **External Interfaces Requirements**: Requirements of interfaces that are connected with the application
- **Functional Requirements**: Detailed functional needs of the application.
- **Use Cases**: Typical scenarios and interactions with users.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Interactions between components during defined use cases.
- **Formal Analysis**: Analysis using Alloy to verify goals.

### 2. Design Document (DD)

The DD details the technical implementation based on the RASD, covering:

- **Component View**: Graphical representation of main components and their interconnections.
- **Deployment View**: Deployment strategy, including firewalls, load balancers, DBMS, operating systems, etc.
- **Component Interfaces**: Methods exposed by each component.
- **Runtime View**: Step-by-step interactions between components.
- **Integration and Testing Plan**: Strategy for developing, integrating, and testing components.

### 3. Implementation and Testing Document (ITD)

The ITD covers the practical aspects of the application implementation, including:

- **Frameworks**: React for the front-end, Spring for the back-end, and MyBatis for database interaction.
- **Database**: MariaDB for its MySQL compatibility and functionality.
- **Programming Languages**: Choices and justifications.
- **Code Structure**: Organization of back-end and front-end code.
- **Testing**: Methods and strategies for testing the application.
- **Installation and Startup**: Instructions for installing and starting the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: React framework for handling user requests and interactions.
- **Back-end**: Spring framework for processing requests and interacting with the database.
- **Database Integration**: MyBatis for dynamic query execution in Java.
- **DBMS**: MariaDB for database management.

## GitHub Integration

Please note that GitHub-related functions in this application will not work as they require a personal token from the account created for CodeKataBattle. This token will not be provided for security reasons.

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on installing and running the application, please refer to the Implementation and Testing Document.
